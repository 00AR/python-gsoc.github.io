<h1>Python Sub-org Ideas Template</h1>

<p>There are not very many strict requirements for Google Summer of Code Ideas pages, but
there are some things that students often ask us for. This page is intended as a starting
template for organizations so you don't forget those things.

<p>Warning: In 2014, many orgs got rejected because their ideas pages were offline when
Google checked. <strong>Make sure your ideas page is hosted somewhere that Google's Open Source
Programs Office will be able to access when they check!</strong>

<h2>About MyOrg</h2>

<p>Tell the students a bit about your organization. Here's some questions you might want to
answer:

<ul>
    <li>What software are you creating?
    <li>Why is it interesting?
    <li>Who uses it?
    <li>What languages is it written in?
    <li>How is it going to change the world?
</ul>


<h2>Contacting MyOrg</h2>

<ul>
   <li>IRC channel:
   <li>Mailing list(s):
	<li>List contact methods you actually use and will have mentors monitoring!
</ul>


<p>Include any special instructions/info about communicating: e.g. what time zones are your
mentors in? do you prefer it if gsoc students introduce themselves first or just dive in?
are there any common mistakes students make when making a first impression?

<h2>Getting Started</h2>

<p>Links to setup instructions go here. Some suggested things to answer:

<ul>
    <li>Where is the link to a setup guide for new developers?
    <li>Are there any unusual libraries/applications that need to be installed first?
    <li>What type of source control do you use? (include links to help and setup guides!)
    <li>What's the process for submitting your first bug fix?
    <li>Where should students look to find easy bugs to try out?
</ul>

<h2>Writing your GSoC application</h2>

<p>Links to advice about applications and the application template goes here.

<ul>
	<li>Remind your students that your sub-org name must be in the title of their
applications!
	<li>Here's a link to the <a href="studenttemplate.html">Student Application
Template for Python</a>
</ul>

<h2>Project Ideas</h2>

<p>You should usually have a couple of project ideas, ranging in difficulty from beginner to
expert. Please do try to have at least one, preferably several beginner tasks: GSoC gets a
lot of students with minimal open source experience who feel very discouraged (and
sometimes even complain to google) if orgs don't any have projects at their level.

<h3>1. Project name</h3>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Project description</strong>: Make sure you have a high-level description that any student can
understand, as well as deeper details

    <li><strong>Skills</strong>: programming languages? specific domain knowledge?

    <li><strong>Difficulty level</strong>: Easy/Intermediate/Hard classification (students ask for this info
frequently to help them narrow down their choices. Difficulty levels are something google
wants to see, so they aren't optional; make your best guess.)

    <li><strong>Related Readings/Links</strong>: was there a mailing list discussion about this topic?
standards you want the students to read first? bugs/feature requests?

    <li><strong>Potential mentors</strong>: A list of mentors likely to be involved with this project, so
students know who to look for on IRC/mailing lists if they have questions. (If you've had
trouble with students overwhelming specific mentors, feel free to re-iterate here if
students should contact the mailing list to reach all mentors.)
</ul>

<h3>2. Project name</h3>

    <p>As above. etc. Unless there's a compelling reason to sort in some other order, ideas
should be ordered approximately from easiest to hardest.
