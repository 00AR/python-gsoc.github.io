<h1>Google Summer of Code 2017 @ the Python Software Foundation</h1>

<p><a href="http://python.org">Python</a> is a popular high-level programming language. It is a general-purpose
language used by scientists, developers, and many others who want to get
things done quickly and effectively.

<p><a href="http://code.google.com/soc/">Google Summer of Code</a> is a global
program that offers post-secondary students an opportunity to be paid for
contributing to an open source project over a three month period. Since 2005,
the Python Software Foundation has served as an "umbrella organization" to a
variety of Python-related projects, as well as sponsoring projects related to
the development of the Python language.  It is our intention to apply again
for the 2017 season!

<p>The 2017 PSF GSoC coordinator is TerriOda. (terri on Freenode IRC, terrioda
at gmail.com, but please email gsoc-admins(at)python(dot)org if you wish to
contact an admin. Students should almost always email
gsoc-general(at)python(dot)org.)

<p>The other org admins include James Lopeman (meflin on IRC), Florian Fuchs
(florianf on IRC), Kushal Das (kushal on IRC) and Stephen Turnbull
(yaseppochi on IRC)

<h2>Getting Started</h2>

<p> Here's 7 things
you can do to get started in free and open source software:

<ol type="1"><li><strong>Choose an
organization to work with.</strong>
<br />See &quot;<a class="https"
href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/SummerOfCode/FrequentlyAskedQuestions#How_do_I_choose_a_project_or_a_sub-org.3F">How
do I choose a project or a sub-org?</a>&quot;  if you need help choosing.
Don't forget, you can try working with more than one organization to see
which one suits you best!

<ul>
<li>Experience with *any* open source group will help you prepare for GSoC.
If you decide to write an application for GSoC you'll need to choose from our
list of registered sub-orgs, but you can experiment before you get to the
application stage.</li>

<li>Asking mentors to choose your project for you
typically leaves a bad first impression.  At least try to narrow down your
choices a bit on your own!</li>

<li>Look through <a
href="/moin/SummerOfCode/2016#Python_Sub-orgs_and_Project_Ideas">our list of
GSoC 2016 sub-orgs</a> to get a sense of who might participate in 2017.  This
page will be updated when we know, with a complete list sometime late in
February.
</li>

</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Start communicating with the developers.</strong><br />
Join the mailing list, IRC channel, or any other communication channels the
developers use.  Listen, get to know the people involved, and ask questions.

<ul>
<li>If you want to make the best
first impression, DO NOT start emails with &quot;Dear Sir.&quot;  Python has
many mentors who are female and/or prefer other forms of address.  Try
&quot;Dear developers&quot; if  you're sending a general email, or use
whatever name they use on their email if you're addressing a specific person.
Culturally speaking, first names or chosen nicknames are fine for most open
source projects. </li>

<li><strong>DO</strong> ask your question in public.  Being able
to participate in the open is a signal to developers that you're ready to
participate in open source/free software, so it can improve your chances of
being accepted to GSoC.  It also means others can benefit from seeing your
questions and the answers you get.</li>

<li><strong>DON'T</strong> Ask to
ask.  Just get right to the point and ask your question without asking if
you're allowed to ask a question first.  See <a class="https"
href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/SummerOfCode/FrequentlyAskedQuestions#What_does_.22don.27t_ask_to_ask.22_mean.3F">What
does &quot;don't ask to ask?&quot; mean?</a> for more explanation. </li></ul></li>

<li><strong>Set up your own development environment.</strong>
<br />
This can be a lot of work the first time, so budget time for it, and don't
forget that you're going to want to run the code you've written, so you'll
need some sort of test environment.  This is a good time to practice asking
good questions and helping improve setup instructions! </li>

<li><strong>Find some bugs and try to fix
them.</strong>
<br />Many projects have bugs tagged as &quot;easy&quot;,
&quot;bite-size&quot;, or &quot;beginner-friendly&quot; that will be easier
for new contributors. <ul><li>Note that if you apply as a student with the
PSF you will be asked to submit a code sample, generally code related to your
project.  A few fixed bugs with code accepted upstream will make your
application look great! </li>

<li>Some projects
have beginner-friendly &quot;bite-sized&quot; bugs listed in the OpenHatch
search engine, found here: <a class="http"
href="http://openhatch.org/search/">http://openhatch.org/search/</a> but many
do not, so try searching for tags like "easy" or "beginner" in your project's
bug tree.  Remember, competition for easy bugs is very high during GSoC so
it can be hard to find one that's flagged.  If you don't see anything, read
through the bugs and choose a few that sound like something you can fix.</li>

<li>Having trouble figuring out which
bugs are beginner-friendly?  Try searching for terms like &quot;easy&quot; in
the bug tracker.  Or just choose a bug that sounds easy to you and try to get
started on it!  What's easy for you may not be easy for others, so take
advantage of your own skills and experience where you can.  Remember to ask
for help if you get stuck for too long, &quot;I'm a new contributor and was
trying to work on bug#123456.  I have a question about how to...&quot;  -- if
people can't help, sometimes they will be able to suggest another bug which
would be more beginner-suitable. </li>

<li>Other &quot;easy&quot; bug ideas: look for typos
and fix them.  Set up new tests -- even if your project decides they don't
need the first one you write, the practice of writing test cases will be
useful for other development (e.g. when you want to add a new feature and
need to include tests for it).  Try using a tool like pylint to find style
issues and correct those. (But pay attention to your project's style guide!
Not everyone cares about the same things.) </li></ul></li>

<li><strong>Find bugs and report them.</strong>
<br />It's always a
good idea to get familiar with your project's bug reporting process.  Writing
excellent bug reports is a really useful skill, so try googling &quot;<a
class="https"
href="https://www.google.com/search?q=writing+good+bug+reports&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8">writing
good bug reports</a>&quot; and learn to write really great ones.  You might
even be able to help improve other people's bug reports by duplicating their
results and asking questions to fill in information they didn't provide.
</li>

<li><strong>Help with documentation.</strong>
<br /> As a beginner in your project,
you're going to see things that are confusing that more experienced
developers may not notice.  Take advantage of your beginner mindset and make
sure to document anything you think is missing! </li>

<li><strong>Help others.</strong>
<br /> This is a great idea for many reasons: explaining things can
help you learn them better, demonstrating your skills as a good community
member can make you more memorable when your mentors have to choose
candidates, and being helpful makes your community a better place! </li>

<h2>Project Ideas</h2>

<p>This section will contain information about sub-orgs and their project
ideas once they have gotten in touch with the PSF. If you're unsure whether
your favourite Python-based project will be participating, ask them and
encourage them to sign up!</p>

<p>Note that some of these groups may have applied as separate mentoring
organizations. We're listing everyone who wants to be listed here to help
students find great Python projects, and we'll separate out the listing to
make it clear which ones are under our umbrella and which are participating
on their own after Google makes their selections. </p>
